# Data-Analytics-and-Application-in-Fashion-Industry
 * When we view and analyze the data in Fashion analytics story. We begin with a high-level overview of sales.

 
  # Sales by country
  - Here in first story.We can see important features such as net sales and gross profit margins, the number of orders, the average order value of purchase.
     We can compare these metrics on a year-to-year basis to determine where there is growth or decline in the key performance indicators
  - There is a 1% increase in profit margins in 2020 compared to 2019. In 2020 we made more sales companies than the previous year, more than double the sales.
  - This shows an increase in the total order value discounts and gross sales.
  - But ultimately the gross profit margins determine the growth. It is a crucial metric for all businesses.
# Consumer engagement 
- In Tier 2 which are the highest paying customers, make up for the smallest consumer cluster, they exceed the no. of any order almost therefold compared to any other two clusters.n
- Importantly their average value is 3 times as high compared to tier 3, the lowest paying customer, and almost twice as high compared to the second tier. clearly, this tier outperforms the rest and is where a company should invest to keep the consumer on the website and could be where marketing focuses its campaign on acquiring new users with the same.
# Customer Lifecycle
- We turn the customer life cycle by looking at the frequency curve. It is clear that the majorites of our consumer base have made a single purchase on the website.
- So this is to be excepted, the company should focus its effort, on uncompelling customers to stay active on the website and make repeat purchase, to stay active on the web site and make repeat purchase.
- Repurchasing curve the average time takes for the majority of consumers to repurchase is a crucial element of fashion. It determines when we must target consumer base before they have become inactive and we lose them.
- As we can see in repurchase curve most of consumer repuchase in a short span of just a few months.In fact, almost 70% of repuchases come after four months or less.
- This data also indicator that this data comes from a retailer from the fast fashion industry rather than a luxury brand.
- As a final point, Frequency and repurchase curves are a key metrics to measure the consumer base.
